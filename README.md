# IOTClock
Alarm clock that informs user on when to wake!

Android app syncs to user's Jawbone smartband and pulls sleep cycle data from band to analyse it and determine the optimal sleep amount for the user each night. Also syncs to user's Google Calendar Account to determine the first event of the next day, taking 'getting ready' and 'travel' time into consideration as well.
